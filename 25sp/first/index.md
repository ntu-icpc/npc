Nanyang Programming Contest 2025: The 1st Contest
</a>

## Introduction

**Nanyang Programming Contest (NPC) 2025: The 1st Contest** is organized by the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) teams in the College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU). The contest aims to promote competitive programming in NTU's community. Moreover, the contest aims to train students to be better problem solvers in facing the Online Assessment (OA) during job seeking.

## Details of the Contest

- **Date**: 15th March 2025
- **Time**: 1:30PM - 5:00PM
- **Venue**: Software Project Lab

| Time            | Details                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1:30PM - 2:00PM | Registration & Pre-contest preparation |
| 2:00PM - 4:00PM | Contest                                |
| 4:00PM - 5:00PM | Contest Discussion                     |

The contest discussion is conducted to discuss the solutions to the problems in the contest.

## Eligibility Requirements

The contestant must be a matriculated undergraduate student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). If the contestant has been accepted to represent NTU in any ICPC season, the contestant is **not** allowed to participate in this contest.

## Contest Format (Partial Scoring)

### Contest Tasks

The contest consists of 4 to 8 algorithmic problems which are to be solved by writing code. Each problem is given a problem score which is the maximum attainable score from that problem. Each problem has a time limit and memory limit, which are the maximum allowable runtime and maximum allowable memory size, respectively.

### Scoring of the contest

The contest adopts the rules known as "Partial Scoring". Each solution (code) submitted to each problem is known as a submission. The submission is tested against multiple test cases that are not revealed to the contestant. A submission passes a test case if the solution produces the correct output within the time limit and memory limit of the problem. The score of the problem for each submission is the multiplication of the problem score and the fraction of test cases passed by the submission over the total number of test cases for the problem. Mathematically, suppose the problem $$i$$ has a maximum score of $$s_i$$ and $$t_i$$ test cases. If a submission passes $$r_i$$ (which is less than or equal to $$t_i$$), the score for the submission is $$s_i \cdot \frac{r_i}{t_i}$$. The score for the problem is the maximum score out of all submissions. The score of the contestant is the **sum** of scores the contestant gets for each problem.

### Additional Remarks

We guarantee that all problems are solvable within the time limit and memory limit by the following programming languages: C, C++, Java, and python.

### Prizes

The ranking is sorted according to the following order.

- The ranking is first sorted in descending order of the score of the contestant.
- Among contestants with the same score, the ranking is sorted in ascending order of penalty. The penalty is calculated by the sum of the time used from the beginning of the contest until the first submission achieving the score for each problem.

The prizes are awarded as follows.

- Contestants in the the top $$10 \%$$ in the ranking will be awarded the gold/silver/bronze prizes.
- Contestants in the next $$10 \%$$ in the ranking will be given consolation prizes.

| Tiers           | Prizes      |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Gold            | 100 Sgd     |  
| Silver          | 75 Sgd      |                                
| Bronze          | 50 Sgd      |
| Consolation     | 20 Sgd      |

* You are in the top $X \%$ if you your ranking is less than or equal to $\frac{X}{100} \cdot N$, where $N$ is the number of contestants that are both present in the lab and submit at least one submission.

* As it is our first time in organizing programming contest, the details are subject to changes.
